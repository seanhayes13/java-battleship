## Battleship

This was a final project for a course I took in college. Base assignment was to write a program that would allow two human players to play battleship, place their ships on the board, orient them to either run north-south or east-west, type in the grid to call, display the results on a board.

I finished the base assignment quickly (slow nights working night shift with not much else to do) and started asking myself how hard would it be modify the code to have the program call shots and let a human player play against the program. Which lead to the obvious: play out the end scene of Wargames and have the program play a match of Battleship against itself.
